I am a PhD candidate in Cosmology and Machine Learning at CEA Paris-Saclay, supervised by Arnaud de Mattia and [FranÃ§ois Lanusse](https://flanusse.net/). I am also a member of the [DESI collaboration](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/), which is building the largest 3D map of the Universe to date. 

My research primarily focuses on **field-level modeling** and **scalable Bayesian inference**, to extract maximum information from cosmological surveys, leveraging fast and differentiable cosmological models and high-dimensional ($\geq 10^6$) sampling methods. My current efforts center on **field-level inference of primordial non-Gaussianity from DESI**.

I am also a member of the <a href="https://www.desi.lbl.gov/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DESI collaboration</a>, which is building the largest 3D map of the Universe to date.</p> <p>My research primarily focuses on <strong>field-level modeling</strong> and <strong>scalable Bayesian inference</strong>, to extract maximum information from cosmological surveys, leveraging fast and differentiable cosmological models and high-dimensional ($\geq 10^6$) sampling methods. My current efforts center on <strong>field-level inference of primordial non-Gaussianity from DESI</strong>.</p> </body></html>
